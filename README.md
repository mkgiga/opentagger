### Using the Release (Recommended)

2. Extract the zip file to a location of your choice.
3.  - **For Windows users:** Navigate into the extracted `opentagger` folder, right-click `run.ps1`, and select `Run with PowerShell`.
    - **For Linux users:** Open your terminal, `cd` into the extracted `opentagger` folder, then execute `chmod +x ./run.sh` followed by `./run.sh`.

### Manual Installation (via Git Clone)

#### Windows
1. Clone the repository by opening your command line and entering:
   `git clone https://github.com/mkgiga/opentagger.git`
2.  Navigate into the newly created `opentagger` folder (e.g., `cd opentagger`).
3.  Inside the `opentagger` folder, **right-click on `run.ps1` and select "Run with PowerShell"**.
